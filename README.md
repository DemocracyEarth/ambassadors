## A message from Santiago Siri & the DEF Team




**Hello future Ambassador!** We need your help to bring our message to all four corners of the world üåé, and create a global movement that will redefine what democracy is in the 21st century! 

As an Ambassador, help us spread üì£ ideas of [Liquid Democracy](https://words.democracy.earth/frozen-in-the-past-no-more-the-promise-of-liquid-democracy-e2a067be18bc) into your hometown and start Democracy Earth meetups, so we can bring the community in and kickstart a debate about what kind of democracy do we want in the internet age!

Our platform [Sovereign](https://vote.democracy.earth/) is in alpha, and still under development, but we need to bring in the decision makers: those organizations, collectives and institutions that can significantly benefit by implementing liquid democracy practices in their own governance - that's where you, our Ambassadors, come in. 

Our belief in democracy means we believe that human collaboration is the best possible way to arrive at great solutions, therefore we use Github and document our work as open source projects where anyone is free to contribute. Democracy is always a work in progress, and so is our work: we encourage you to take an active role in building it with us, making suggestions and creating debates! 

We will give you resources to help you carry the message and implement our work: videos and slides so you can make presentations in the name of Democracy Earth, and also technical information of how to implement sovereign in a local server so your local groups can start using it! 

You can find all of our source code [here on Github](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign), and engage with us - both on [Github's issues](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues) and [Slack](http://chat.democracy.earth/) - discussing our paper, [The Social Smart Contract](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper), where we are debating liquid democracy with collaborators from all over the world! We have also created a channel on Slack called [#ambassadors_def](https://democracyearth.slack.com/messages/ambassadors_def/), where you will be able to connect with all the Ambassadors, share and learn from each other experiences!

As an ambassador of Democracy Earth you will represent the Democracy Earth Foundation vision of a borderless, post-nation state world, its mission to put the tools of liquid democracy in the hands of every self-sovereign global citizen of the world, and our values of being open source, transparent, accountable, and decentralized. It is fundamental that you embody our open-source values, welcoming everyone into our collaborative work as co-creators of the future of democracy. **This is a guideline we have put together with all the information you need to get started!**


# Program Overview

<a name="Step-1"></a>
## **STEP 1 - Apply**

* Read [The Social Smart Contract](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/blob/master/README.mediawiki).
* Sign the [Terms & Conditions for Democracy Earth Ambassadors](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhepWTHYBr7vBH3Df9bdGJbo6SUXumN2isyRqJkVKyW4xlAg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and  the [Image Release Form](https://goo.gl/forms/ShXvSMYinQTT4DXA3).

<!--- COMMENTED OUT UNTIL CREATION OF DEF-materials.md * Familiarize yourself with [DEF materials.](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/DEF_materials.md) --->
* Fill in the [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwFO4SupMFoG2z3fHlrMFZpg9pm5f-EUblcIIgVs1CY6M5jg/viewform). 
* **Share your vision with the world!** Send us a < 2 minute video to **hello@democracy.earth** sharing what is your inspiration, why these ideas matter to you and your country, and what you would like to accomplish as an Ambassador for Democracy Earth. Make sure to say your name, country, city and contact information so others from your area can connect with you. Our goal is to create a database of videos that can portrait the global scale and the excitement around the movement we are creating. Most importantly, we want to show other people **why these ideas matter.** Why they are relevant, and why they should learn about them as well. In your video, don't aim at us, but instead talk to the public at large, the people that you want to engage. We have read about you in your application, and now we want you to show your unique vision and voice to the world as well. 


All e-mails should have: **"I want to be an Ambassador for Democracy Earth"** as a title. Be sure to write a short bio in the e-mail including your full name, where you live (city, country), what is your background and platform, if you have one, and most importantly: why you are inspired to be a DEF Ambassador üòä. All videos will go to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbnrw21wKi1T-h26FLUN2ag) so we can show how our movement is growing globally, and they might go into the work of filmmakers wanting to document and promote Democracy Earth! For inspiration purposes, make sure to check the [amazing work that DEF Ambassador Sunny Sangha is doing in the UK üá¨üáß!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsz7MjMJ5J8)

üëâ After following these steps, we will get in touch and schedule a meeting with one of DEF core team members by video conference to discuss your Ambassador strategies and tactics!
